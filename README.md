# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
Projects @ Iron Hack Bootcamp in Data Science &amp; Machine Learning

Throughout my time at IronHack, I completed several projects to solidify and practice the concepts learned during the bootcamp. This repository contains a collection of those projects, showcasing a variety of skills and techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and software development.

## **Repository Structure**
Each project is contained within its own folder, and each folder includes a README.md file with a brief description of the project for better understanding.
