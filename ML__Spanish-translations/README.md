# Project in Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice how to process text to identify whether a sentence was automatically translated or translated by a human.

## Project Overview

The given repository for training the model is a dataset containing sentences in Spanish and their tags: 
    0, if the sentences were translated by a Machine 
    1, if the sentence was translated by a professional translator 
The goal is to build a classifier that is able to distinguish between the two.

Later in the project, a new dataset with sentences and without tags was shared. the purpose is to predict whether these senteces were automatically translated or translated by a human.

## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Python code that conducts the analysis.
2. **Text Datasets**: Datasets with the training data, test data (REAL_DATA), and the predicted tags.
