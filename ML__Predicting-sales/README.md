# Business Challenge: Machine Learning

## Introduction

To begin with, it was given a dataset containing information on shopsâ€™ sales per day (and several characteristics of them), and the goal is to predict the sales.


## Project Overview

Training data (640841 entries): It was shared a training set of store sales per day, with bits of information of what happened in that day in that store.
This dataset was shared to start the project and train and test the models.

Real-Life Data (+70k entries): It was shared the test set with several entries without the sales. This will be used (on the teachers side) to verify how good the model built was performing and predicting the sales.


## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Python code with the machine learning project
2. **Presentation** Project presentation
3. **Datasets** Datasets with the training data, test data (REAL_DATA), and the predicted sales
