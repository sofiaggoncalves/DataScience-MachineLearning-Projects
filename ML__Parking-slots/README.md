# Project in Image Processing and Computer Vision

## Introduction
The field of computer vision is revolutionizing the way machines interact with the visual world. Through this project, students will engage with fundamental techniques in image classification, applying machine learning models to real-world datasets, providing hands-on experience in both developing and deploying classifiers that can discern between different categories of objects in images.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into several phases, each designed to deepen the understanding and skills in computer vision:

1. **Dataset**:
[Parking Lot Detection]: The dataset is designed for developing and testing parking lot vehicle detection algorithms.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, features, and the challenges it presents, documenting the findings and initial thoughts on how to approach the classification problem.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Preprocess the images to get them ready for training.
   - Select and apply a machine learning algorithm to build a classifier.
   - Train the model and optimize its parameters to achieve the best performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Validate the model using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
   - Discuss the performance of the model and any potential biases or limitations.

## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Python code that conducts the analysis.
2. **Report**: Detailed report documenting the EDA findings, model development process, evaluation metrics, and conclusions about the model's performance.
3. **Presentation**: Short presentation that overviews the project, from the dataset analysis to the final model evaluation.
4. **Dataset**\
   ● Video, with the parking space and a clear view of the spots and their occupancy, including a longer video, a smaller version, and two cropped videos, all the same shots.\
   ● Mask Images, binary images containing a map of the parking spots.\
   ● Not_empty Folder: Contains more than 3,000 images of occupied spots for training purposes (reduced to a sample of 10 for GitHub).\
   ● Empty Folder: Contains more than 3,000 images of empty spots for training
   purposes (reduced to a sample of 10 for GitHub).
