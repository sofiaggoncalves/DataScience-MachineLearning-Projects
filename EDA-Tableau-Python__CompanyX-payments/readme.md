# Business Challenge: Cohort Analysis for CompanyX Payments

## Introduction

CompanyX Payments, a forward-thinking financial services company, has been offering innovative cash advance solutions since its inception in 2020. With a commitment to providing money advancements for free and transparent pricing, CompanyX Payments has garnered a substantial user base. As part of their continuous effort to enhance their services and understand user behavior, CompanyX Payments has commissioned a cohort analysis project.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive cohort analysis based on data provided by CompanyX Payments. The main objective is to analyze user cohorts defined by the month of creation of their first cash advance, tracking the monthly evolution of key metrics for these cohorts.

### Metrics to Analyze

Calculate and analyze the following metrics for each cohort:

1. **Frequency of Service Usage:** Understand how often users from each cohort utilize CompanyX Payments' cash advance services over time.
2. **Incident Rate:** Determine the incident rate, specifically focusing on payment incidents, for each cohort. Identify if there are variations in incident rates among different cohorts.
3. **Revenue Generated by the Cohort:** Calculate the total revenue generated by each cohort over months to assess the financial impact of user behavior.
4. **New Relevant Metric:** Propose and calculate a new relevant metric that provides additional insights into user behavior or the performance of CompanyX Payments' services.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The cohort analysis was done using Python, primarily leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. 
Before diving into cohort analysis, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, exploring key statistics, distributions, and visualizations to identify patterns and outliers. 

### Data Quality Analysis

Assess the quality of the dataset by identifying missing values, data inconsistencies, and potential errors. Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability of your analysis. Document any data quality issues encountered and the steps taken to address them.

### Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Python code that conducts the cohort analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, cohort creation, metric calculation, and visualization.
2. **Exploratory Data Quality Analysis Report:** Report summarizing the findings from the exploratory data analysis and data quality analysis, highlighting any issues and the steps taken to resolve them. Include visualizations and insights that help understand the dataset.
3. **Dataset:** Datasets for the project
