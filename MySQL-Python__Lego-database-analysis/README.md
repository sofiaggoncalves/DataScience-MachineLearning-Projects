# Business Challenge: EDA and SQL

## Introduction

A data project lifeycle has many phases, rather than being just an isolated analysis in a single tool.
The purpose of this project is doing an analysis using both Python and SQL to obtain the final result, by exploring each tool's behaviour

## Project Overview

Pick up a dataset in our common datasets repos and break the work as follows:
 1. Pick a topic and choose a dataset on that topic. Build around 10 Business questions to answer about this topic.
 2. Data Analysis, to understand the dataset and create a report about it
 3. Data Exploration and Business Understanding: 
 	- Import the dataset into SQL
 	- Answer the Business questions with SQL Queries


## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Python code that conducts the analysis and SQL upload.
2. **SQL text file (.sql)** Document with all the queries answering the Business questions
3. **Report** Project documentation
